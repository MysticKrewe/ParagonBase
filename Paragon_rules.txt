Paragon - NEW RULES

Side Drop Targets - 1,2,3 from bottom to top.  Score 500 points per target, all three down score 10k, 15k, 20k, 25k, special

Secret Score: If you drop the three targets in order from bottom to top, score is doubled (i.e. 20k, 30k, etc.)

SKILL SHOT:  Alternate between golden cliffs and Paragon, but also add special on paragon side (hit when lit = 5k bonus, 20k golden rewards 20k when lit, or 10k with longer on time.

Beast (Hunt) MODE: Knock all three right drop targets down to qualify Beast mode.  Lower center standup target will blink at "G" in paragon.  Shoot the lower standup to start Beast Mode.  Shots will flash and move every 4 seconds (mode lasts 45 seconds).  Hit the lit shot and score 25k + extra points based on how many slings/pops/beast (+50,100,500) were hit during that ball.  Subsequent beast modes increase by 25k each time.  Hit top or bottom standup target to stun the beast for a few seconds.

If you qualify Beast Mode but do not start it, it will carry over to other balls.  If you qualify beast mode more than once before starting it, beast modes will stack.  Each stacked beast qualification is 2x,3x, etc.

Questions:

1.  Does it matter if I add different int types together, like unsigned long= unsigned long + unsigned int?

2.  Is there any provision to deal with a broken drop target?  If it's detected down will it keep re-firing the reset?
